				<td><h2>Raw material procuring and storage</h2>
					<p>Our factory is situated in the richest belt of Coconut Field in South India. The Coconuts are available here from more than 50,000 hectares of coconut farms around our factory. Our province is having the excellent quality of natural water since the famous courtallam fresh water falls is only 5 kilometers away from our factory.</p>
					<p>So it is quite natural that we can produce the best quality of Cocopeat. The total factory area comes around 15 acres  and the expansion process is on. We have our own vehicles through which we can procure the raw material without any problem in the transportation.</p>
					<p>As per our quality control policy, For Cocopeat, we are selecting the coconuts from the farms which are very close to the riverside to achieve the best quality. Raw Materials of good quality are obtained from the surrounding factories  and they undergo stringent testing under secure conditions preventing from external seeds/weeds. As we are having huge stock of raw materials we are keeping in to separate yards. The total area of our stockyard is 7 acres.</p>
					<h3>Washing to reduce the E.C.level</h3>
					<p>The raw material is washed with fresh water to reduce the E.C. level. We have Four washing slots and we are using a specific technology in washing to ensure that the material is evenly washed. Frequently Tests are done to confirm the E.C level of the material. One more cross check test will be done and finally the washed material will go for drying process.<br />
					</p>
					<h3>Drying on the cement yard</h3>
					<p>The washed material then dried to open sky in the cement yard. The Drying Process is undertaken in the vast spread cement yard (80,000 sq.ft.,) which is free of foreign particles surrounded by a compound wall. The material will be collected at sufficient moisture. At this level the tests for moisture is done. Once the moisture level of the material is reached, it gets ready for screening.</p>
					<h3>Screening </h3>
					<p>We have revolving screeners, Bed type vibrators and sand separators that can be used to remove the outside substances if any presented in the washed material. Then the material will be ready for compaction.</p>
					<h3>Checking</h3>
					<p>Our Factory is equipped with an excellent laboratory. With experienced, highly qualified quality control officers, we ensure that each and every block manufactured in our factory is thoroughly gone through all tests like E.C level, P.H.level and moisture etc. </p>
<p>We are keeping the sample batch by batch and can assure that not even a single product will be rejected by our clients.</p>
					<h3>Compactation</h3>
					<p>We have well experienced skilled labours in our factory to make our product the unique one. Our factory is consisting of well-developed machineries and we are very particular in our productâ€™s quality. We have 5 kg block making machine and 650 grams block making machines. We can produce good quality of Cocopeat blocks with the well-equipped machineries we have in our factory. <br />
