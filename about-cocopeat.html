				<td valign="top"><p>Cocopeat is a natural fibre made out of coconut husks. The extraction of the coconut fibre from husks gives us this by-product called cocopeat.</p>
					<p><img src="images/what-is-cocopeat.jpg" width="529" height="233" alt="What is Cocopeat" /></p>
					<h3>Why Cocopeat</h3>
					<p>Cocopeat or Coir Fiber Pith is derived as a byproduct in the process of fiber extraction from the Husk of the coconut. The eco-friendly material Cocopeat is a 100% natural growing medium. Cocopeat is dried under natural sunlight, and processed to produce various growing mechanisms. Cocopeat has a highly porous material structure. Hence Cocopeat can absorb large volumes of water. Generally Cocopeat can absorb water about half of its volume and 5 to 6 times its weight. Cocopeat has great oxygenation properties. That makes Cocopeat rooting solutions highly suitable for potting mixtures. </p>
					<p>Its high lignin percentage - 31% - makes cocopeat very stable and slowly decomposing. In general it takes about 10 years to decompose. Even decomposed coir pith is used as hydroponics systems for growing roses. Cocopeat has a carbon-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 104:1. Cocopeat can store and release nutrients to plants for long periods of time. pH value of Cocopeat ranges between 5.2 and 6.8 which is neutral to slightly acidic. </p>
					<p>However, for horticultural use, Cocopeat products must have specific chemical and biological standards such as suitable pH-level, electrical conductivity and elemental composition. We have a well-experienced team of agronomists who purchase quality-proofed coir pith. The specifications that have to be fulfilled by Cocopeat are: Density &lt;0.1, Electrical Conductivity &lt;0.5 m S/cm, pH&lt;5.9-6.5, Water holding capacity &lt;8-9 times, Pore space &gt;90%, Expandability &gt; 6 times of the compressed volume. Clean and high-quality coir contain natural rooting hormones and anti-fungal properties.</p>
					<p>Cocopeat products can be mixed with fertilizers and nutrients according to the specific requirements of the plants.</p>
					<h3>Where Cocopeat products are being used</h3>
					<p>Cocopeat is now used as a medium for seedling nurseries, for bedding plants, for potting mix supplies, for landscaping, and for the hydroponic production of flowers, vegetables, trees, shrubs, compost bins, container gardening, casing layer for mushroom. Currently Cocopeat stands out as the eco-friendly and more reliable replacement for the sphagnum peat moss, rock wool and sawdust. Our Cocopeat-based products provide an excellent growing and rooting medium for hydroponics or container-based plant growing.</p>
					<h3>Advantages of Cocopeat</h3><br />

					<ol>
						<li>Excellent water retention properties. Cocopeat needs less watering (up to 65%) as compared to the peat moss. It holds water rather than shedding it like the traditional peat moss.</li>
						<li>The rapid re-wet ability and quick draining characteristic of Cocopeat also reduces the loss of nutrients through leaching.</li>
						<li>The pH content of Cocopeat is neutral to slightly acidic, and is therefore very beneficial for plants</li>
						<li>The coconut peat is a better natural soil conditioner; it prevents the hardening of potting soil and increases soil porosity.</li>
						<li>The coconut peat is resistant to bacterial, weed, fungal growth, and is truly pathogen free.</li>
						<li>Naturally high lignin content promotes the development of favorable micro-organisms.</li>
						<li>Cocopeat can be used as a soil less growth medium for hydroponics.</li>
						<li>It is good both for indoor and outdoor use.</li>
						<li>Cocopeat are entierly organic. There is no harmful effects on the environment when disposed of.</li>
						<li>Cocopeat is physically stable and is very slow to disintegrate. It only begins to break down when it is 10  years old.</li>
						<li>Cocopeat is reusable and recyclable for up to four years.<br />

		<p>Cocopeat is also known as Coir pith, Coir Fiber pith, Coir dust. It is used as a solid additive, due to low level of nutrition content in the Cocopeat it is mixed with nutrients and used as growing medium for plants.</p>
